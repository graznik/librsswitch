librsswitch
===========
librsswitch (remote socket switch) is a Raspberry Pi Linux library for controlling remote controlled power sockets.
The library emulates the encoder chip within the power socket remote control, so a separate 433 MHz sender is needed.

librsswitch is written in C and heavily inspired by rcswitch-pi [1], which is based on rc-switch [2].


Supported devices
-----------------
At the moment librsswitch supports the following devices:

- REV 008345 (PT2260-R4S)
- Pollin 2605 (PT2262)


Hardware setup
--------------
See the librsswitch Wiki [3] for a detailed description of how to set up the entire hardware.


Software setup
--------------
Install the bcm2835 C library [4] on your Raspberry Pi:
    $ wget  http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.17.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf bcm2835-1.17.tar.gz
    $ cd bcm2835-1.17
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make check
    $ sudo make install

Get the librsswitch sources:
    $ git clone https://github.com/graznik/librsswitch.git


Usage
-----
Use function socket_send() from within your program to either switch a socket on or off.

socket_send(uint dev, uint group, uint socket, uint data);

- dev: Vendor ID (check the table of supported devices)
- group: Socket group
- socket: Socket within a socket group
- data: 1 = On, 0 = Off
